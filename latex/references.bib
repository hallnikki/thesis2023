	abstract = {Just before {WWII}, the British government prepared for an aerial onslaught that was predicted to raze cities and cause mass casualties. By 1938, the Air Raid Precautions Act officially stated that population protection would be through dispersal, meaning evacuation and small-scale protection, local authority responsibility often devolving to householders. Archaeological records of remaining air-raid shelters are relatively rare and under threat. This paper reports on geophysical surveys on three sites in Stoke-on-Trent and London. Results found three intact Stanton shelters in Stoke-on-Trent, located by {GPR}, electrical resistivity, magnetometry, gravity and electromagnetic methods. In London, partially demolished shelters and an intact, mass public shelter were both detected by {EM} and {GPR} methods, with subsequent intrusive investigations confirming results. Study outcomes show hitherto-neglected wartime shelters are in varied condition, with geophysical surveys able to detect, characterise and assess them, helping bring {WWII} British history into the wider scientific community and public domain.},

	abstract = {In the 1943 County of London Plan, Forshaw and Abercrombie proposed a significant increase in the provision of green space focusing on areas of deficiency. Of the planned open space system, only two major parks were created: Mile End Park in Tower Hamlets and Burgess Park in Southwark. These parks were created incrementally over the second half of the twentieth century and remain essentially unfinished. Since the mid-1990s, both parks have received significant capital investment. This thesis uses a mixture of qualitative and quantitative data - drawn mainly from a set of in-depth interviews with key players involved in the in the parks' development - to understand their successes and failings. It has found that Mile End Park has become significantly more successful in the last ten years and is now performing relatively well. Using the chosen measures Burgess Park has been found to have some strengths but is significantly under performing. The thesis then explores the key factors that led to these differing outcomes. These include the continued influence of key individuals, an enabling institutional context, effective partnership working with consensus on the future direction of the park, access to significant amounts of capital funding and ring- fenced ongoing revenue funding, innovative and high-quality design, a complementary mix of uses, a varied and well-publicised events programme and effective community involvement throughout the process.},

New York City, as the United States’ largest city and among the nation’s most densely populated, was an early epicenter of the crisis. Modifications to the design, planning and operations of the city’s public realm have been important components of the city’s overall response to mitigate the effects of the pandemic while also facilitating economic recovery and providing social, educational, and recreational opportunities for city residents. This commentary provides an overview of New York City’s urban design responses to {COVID}-19, highlighting some of the successes and limitations of the city’s programs. We conclude by arguing that, in order to be effective, short-term crisis response efforts such as these must eventually be turned into government policies that not only address immediate urgent crises but also begin to facilitate durable long-term recovery and address longstanding systemic inequalities and vulnerabilities.},

While low-{SEI} groups generally traveled shorter distances but visited more city-wide {CBGs} before the pandemic, high-{SEI} residents universally reduced their mobility to a greater extent during the pandemic. Although high-{SEI} residents were making more trips to parks and health-care providers, and fewer subsistence trips to retail stores already before the pandemic, {COVID}-19 significantly widened these differences thereby exacerbating “mobility gaps” between low-{SEI} and high-{SEI} groups. We further examine how such “mobility gaps” can be mitigated by spatial advantages of home locations, controlling for political inclination. We find that living in better transit-served or more walkable neighborhoods generally benefited high-{SEI} residents more than low-{SEI} residents, with some variation across cities. This suggests that built environments not only impact mobility outcomes during “normal” times, but also influence how different socio-economic groups are able to adapt during times of crisis.},

The concept, offering a novel perspective of “chrono-urbanism”, adds to existing thematic of Smart Cities and the rhetoric of building more humane urban fabrics, outlined by Christopher Alexander, and that of building safer, more resilient, sustainable and inclusive cities, as depicted in the Sustainable Development Goal 11 of the United Nations.

	abstract = {Background: One important form of sustainability is the continuation of culture and cultural practices. This study examined the case of Japanese Ohanami or cherry blossom festivals. Historically, Ohanami focused on the cherry blossom as a symbol of spring’s arrival, where communal aspects, consumption of sake and seasonal foods, painting or photography, and pilgrimages to sacred sites were used to celebrate the ephemeral aspects of blossoms, spring, and life. Methods: This study examines how cherry blossom festivals are celebrated and understood and how these celebrations are changing. Results: Current celebrations demonstrate several forces are changing this celebration. The changes in cherry blossom festivals are seen in four areas (bonding, cultural continuity, marketing exploitation, and cultural symbolism). Cherry blossom festivals are also observed overseas—at first glance this suggests its continuity, however, the ways in which Ohanami is observed raise concerns about the accuracy of this cultural practice. Conclusion: Ohanami celebrations are celebrated both in Japan and overseas, and although their practice continues, the nature of the cultural celebrations are changing.},

	shorttitle = {Increasing walking},
	abstract = {Background
Well-designed public open space ({POS}) that encourages physical activity is a community asset that could potentially contribute to the health of local residents.
Methods
In 1995–1996, two studies were conducted—an environmental audit of {POS} over 2 acres (n =516) within a 408-km2 area of metropolitan Perth, Western Australia; and personal interviews with 1803 adults (aged 18 to 59 years) (52.9\% response rate). The association between access to {POS} and physical activity was examined using three accessibility models that progressively adjusted for distance to {POS}, and its attractiveness and size. In 2002, an observational study examined the influence of attractiveness on the use of {POS} by observing users of three pairs of high- and low-quality (based on attractiveness) {POS} matched for size and location.
Results
Overall, 28.8\% of respondents reported using {POS} for physical activity. The likelihood of using {POS} increased with increasing levels of access, but the effect was greater in the model that adjusted for distance, attractiveness, and size. After adjustment, those with very good access to large, attractive {POS} were 50\% more likely to achieve high levels of walking (odds ratio, 1.50; 95\% confidence level, 1.06–2.13). The observational study showed that after matching {POS} for size and location, 70\% of {POS} users observed visited attractive {POS}.
Conclusions
Access to attractive, large {POS} is associated with higher levels of walking. To increase walking, thoughtful design (and redesign) of {POS} is required that creates large, attractive {POS} with facilities that encourage active use by multiple users (e.g., walkers, sports participants, picnickers).},

Although effective in reducing infection rates, the lockdowns have also resulted in a severe negative impact on mental health throughout the world; Setting the foundation for mental illnesses to become the next “silent” pandemic. This study attempts to determine a self-care method of ensuring mental health during the {COVID}-19 pandemic, especially for those living under lockdown. We evaluated the potential of physical exercise (in a nature setting) and nature therapy in improving mental wellbeing, among young adults with either stress, anxiety or depression symptoms. The study involved thirty subjects, who were equally divided into a nature-exercise group and a nature therapy group. The participants were briefed on the activities that they were to perform on a daily basis, and both groups performed their assigned activities concurrently for one week (27th April 2020 to 3rd May 2020) at urban greeneries accessible to them (rooftop parks, neighbourhood parks, home gardens). We used the depression, anxiety and stress scale – 21 items ({DASS}-21) to evaluate the mental health status of participants, once before beginning the study (baseline readings) and once at the end of the study (after a week of nature-exercise/nature therapy). There was a statistically significant reduction in stress, anxiety and depression symptoms for both the nature-exercise and nature therapy groups. However, when evaluating the effectiveness of exercise and nature therapy in treating stress, anxiety and depression symptoms on a case-by-case basis, it was discovered that nature therapy was more effective in treating mental health issues. Hence, nature therapy has the potential to be a form of preventive medicine, namely in preserving mental health during the {COVID}-19 crisis.},

In this exploratory study, we distributed a survey comprised of close- and open-ended questions through convenience sampling in late July 2020 with the aim of understanding (1) if and how sense of belonging to urban green space ({UGS}) has shifted since the start of the pandemic and (2) how do changes in {UGS} use, satisfaction, and sense of belonging relate to sociodemographic characteristics of New York City ({NYC}) neighborhoods. Participants (N = 138) were racially diverse, predominantly female and between 18–44yo with a neighborhood median income of \$67,500. While the level of satisfaction that people feel in relation to their {UGS} did not change with the offset of the pandemic, how much people use these spaces and how much they “feel at home” in them did. Participants reported higher use of {UGS} currently in comparison to their use of these spaces pre-pandemic. This increased use of {UGS} was particularly evident among White participants and participants living in more upper-middle- and upper-income areas. The same trend is evident when it comes to sense of belonging. New Yorkers in general reported a stronger sense of belonging to {UGS} spaces as a result of the pandemic. As with {UGS} use, while both reported a favorable sense of belonging, White and more affluent participants had a stronger sense of belonging pre-pandemic, and their sense of belonging showed greater rise due to the pandemic. Overall, our research suggests that {COVID}-19 has widened existing socio-spatial disparities in {NYC}, with the lowest income neighborhoods most effected. We suggest further exploration of sense of belonging to {UGS} as an avenue to promote urban green equity in multicultural cities.},

Further, a mapping of park-bond funding allocations by location reveals that funding patterns often exacerbate rather than ameliorate existing inequalities in park and open-space resource distributions. Given the lack of large parcels for park acquisition, these results indicate that creative strategies for providing open space—such as utilizing vacant lots, alleys, underutilized school sites, public or utility-owned property, unnecessarily wide streets, and abandoned riverbeds—will be required in the city's older neighborhoods to redress existing inequities in access to parks.},

Shading in urban open spaces has been recognized as an important parameter in modifying microclimatic conditions and enhancing thermal comfort particularly in hot regions. When designed appropriately, shading can mitigate the Urban Heat Island ({UHI}), enhance pedestrian thermal comfort and affect outdoor activities. A decision support tool ({DST}) was developed for evaluating the minimum shading coverage required, by trees or other shading devices, to improve thermal comfort in streets during the most critical hours of the day. The presented {DST} accounts for the density of tree-canopies or the albedo of various materials used for shading devices. To develop the index, a set of climatic simulations was run using the Green {CTTC} model and thermal comfort was determined by the {PET} index. Based on the simulations Open-space Shading Coefficients ({OSC}) were computed and used to develop an Open-space Shading Index ({OSI}). The city of Tel-Aviv, characterized by a hot-humid climate, was selected as a case study. Results demonstrate the viability of the index as a {DST} for assessing the extent of shading required to achieve thermal comfort in urban streets.},

	abstract = {Tree-planting is one of the veritable tools for combating urban heat island and improving thermal comfort in the wake of global warming and urbanization. However, trees of different species and morphological properties have variable solar attenuation capacity and consequently, thermal comfort regulation potential. Besides, the shadow-cast effect by buildings helps in reducing pedestrian radiant load and consequently improves thermal comfort especially in high-density cities even though ventilation is reduced. Therefore, a holistic and contextual understanding of tree-planting and shadow-casting can help in designing climate-proof cities. In this study, we employed the {ENVI}-met model to better understand the interaction between these two forms of shading (trees and buildings) on the pedestrians' thermal comfort in Hong Kong and the influence of one over the other. The impact of different urban densities on the thermal comfort improvement potential by eight (8) common tree-species in Hong Kong was specifically studied. Results show that shallow canyons are susceptible to worse thermal condition when compared to their deeper counterparts with similar aspect ratio value. Of all tree configuration parameters, leaf area index, tree height and trunk height are most influential in improving and aggravating daytime and nighttime thermal comfort, respectively. We also found that trees' effectiveness in improving daytime thermal comfort reduces with increasing urban density and vice-versa for nighttime. For the reference of planners and landscape architects, this study recommends tall trees of low canopy density with high trunk in deeper canyons and vice-versa for shallow canyons and open-areas.},

	abstract = {With considerably increased coverage of weather information in the news media in recent years in many countries, there is also more demand for data that are applicable and useful for everyday life. Both the perception of the thermal component of weather as well as the appropriate clothing for thermal comfort result from the integral effects of all meteorological parameters relevant for heat exchange between the body and its environment. Regulatory physiological processes can affect the relative importance of meteorological parameters, e.g. wind velocity becomes more important when the body is sweating. In order to take into account all these factors, it is necessary to use a heat-balance model of the human body. The physiological equivalent temperature ({PET}) is based on the Munich Energy-balance Model for Individuals ({MEMI}), which models the thermal conditions of the human body in a physiologically relevant way. {PET} is defined as the air temperature at which, in a typical indoor setting (without wind and solar radiation), the heat budget of the human body is balanced with the same core and skin temperature as under the complex outdoor conditions to be assessed. This way {PET} enables a layperson to compare the integral effects of complex thermal conditions outside with his or her own experience indoors. On hot summer days, for example, with direct solar irradiation the {PET} value may be more than 20 K higher than the air temperature, on a windy day in winter up to 15 K lower.},

	abstract = {The physiological equivalent temperature, {PET}, is a thermal index derived from the human energy balance. It is well suited to the evaluation of the thermal component of different climates. As well as having a detailed physiological basis, {PET} is preferable to other thermal indexes like the predicted mean vote because of its unit (°C), which makes results more comprehensible to urban or regional planners, for example, who are not so familiar with modern human-biometeorological terminology. {PET} results can be presented graphically or as bioclimatic maps. Graphs mostly display the temporal behaviour of {PET}, whereas spatial distribution is specified in bioclimatic maps. In this article, some applications of {PET} are discussed. They relate to the evaluation of the urban heat island in cities in both temperate climates and warm climates at high altitude. The thermal component of the microclimate in the trunk space of a deciduous forest is also evaluated by {PET}. As an example of the spatial distribution of {PET}, a bioclimatic map for Greece in July (Mediterranean climate) is presented.},

	abstract = {The urban heat island ({UHI}) is mostly due to urbanization. This phenomenon in concert with the high temperatures caused by global climate change may profoundly affect human thermal comfort, which can influence human productivity and morbidity especially in spring/summer period. The main objective of this investigation was to determine changes in degree of thermal comfort of Mexico City’s inhabitants and compare it with the physiological equivalent temperature ({PET}) to evaluate whether {PET} and its categorization are adequate to be applied in Mexico City. A series of microclimatological measurements to estimate {PET} were made at four sites including the city’s center. Concomitantly, a series of surveys of thermal perception were applied to 1300 passersby. The results show that {PET} has increased from 1990 to 2020 from 0.1208 °C/year to 0.1498 °C/year in the study sites, in addition to overestimating the degree of thermal comfort of people according to the stablished categories or classes. It is concluded that it is necessary to adjust thermal stress categories. Knowing the percentages of people without thermal comfort will lead us to determine different ranges in environmental parameters to define an acceptable environment for most people.},

Less information exists, however, on how urban green spaces influence outdoor thermal comfort ({OTC}), which is dependent on people’s perceptions of the complex interactions amongst ambient humidity, wind and both air and radiant temperatures. In this study, we analysed an existing {OTC} dataset compiled within a large Singapore urban park and calibrated {OTC} thresholds for physiological equivalent temperatures ({PET}) by analysing {PET} against thermal perception survey responses from the park visitors (n = 1508). We examined {OTC} according to (i) neutral, (ii) acceptable and (iii) preferred temperatures, where respondents felt ‘comfortable’ outdoors in the park. We estimated that neutral temperature, when all respondents experience neither heat nor cold stress, is 26.2 °C; acceptable temperatures, when only slight heat or cold stress is experienced, range between 21.6 and 31.6 °C; and preferred (‘ideal’) temperature for all respondents is 24.2 °C. Respondents residing for more than 6 months in Singapore achieved thermal neutrality, suggesting that a greater degree of thermal adaptation likely developed during acclimatisation to local climate through a combination of physiological, behavioural and psychological circumstances. Comparisons with other {OTC} studies showed differences in synoptic climates are linked to variations in the magnitude and ranges of perceived {PET}. Lastly, respondents in this study perceived lower neutral and preferred temperatures compared to respondents surveyed over a variety of urban land use categories in another local study. The differences in neutral and preferred temperatures between studies suggest that lower park temperatures and different environmental attitudes influence perceived {OTC}.},

	abstract = {Air temperatures in and outside of 60 parks in Taipei city were surveyed to study the effect of different urban parks on their surrounding thermal gradients. Results suggest that the factors governing the temperature of park surroundings are not identical to those of park interiors. Air-temperature gradients surrounding urban parks are influenced by both the horizontal transport of cool or warm air mass above parks and the evapotranspirative air-parcels from trees, creating a cool island larger than the boundaries of cool-island parks, a heat-island larger than the boundaries of strong heat-island parks, and a cool-ring outside weak heat-island parks. Such horizontal air movement is not easily detected using remotely sensed data. During daytime, the thermal environment within a park is dominated by the amount of solar input absorbed by unshaded paved area, which, when strong, can overflow to increase the temperatures of park surroundings; at night, despite park trees causing a warming effect inside parks, park surroundings are cooled by horizontal flow of evapotranspirative air-parcels from park trees. In business and other districts used mostly during daytime, it is recommended that parks and other open spaces be designed with less than 50\% paved area and at least 30\% trees, shrubs, and other shadings. In residential districts that are used mostly during nighttime, parks and other open spaces are recommended to be designed with more trees. Night irrigation, a measure commonly recommended for the conservation of water, is also recommended to further enhance this nighttime cooling.},

	abstract = {The growing urban warming and climate change have prompted thermal comfort being studied under the themes of urban quality and sustainability. However, the piecemeal approaches and standards from various disciplines, coupled with their respective set of parameters, drive thermal comfort to be somehow elusive. This study, therefore, reviewed a series of relevant papers and discussed thermal comfort in a more holistic view. This paper focused on the notion of outdoor thermal comfort at the pedestrian-level in order to redefine the practical variables in outdoor comfort studies, mainly from an urban design perspective. Several quantitative and qualitative criteria related to comfort were incorporated into the discussion, including both thermal and non-thermal factors. This paper, firstly, discussed the discrepancy between indoor comfort and outdoor comfort, and next, the variables involved and thermal perception. In the discussion, it suggested a new area of inquiry in which outdoor thermal comfort might be influenced by nontactile stimuli – for example, visual impacts produced by color, light intensity as well as the attractiveness of scenery. Overall, the paper highlighted that the intervention of human senses plays a vital role in presenting the degree of outdoor comfort. It is physical and phenomenological in response to the richness of climate and outdoor environmental characteristics. In conclusion, outdoor thermal comfort study requires a coherent consideration of interface between human and outdoor environments. The integration of urban parameters into thermal physical and psychological sensations can be an alternative to achieve the integrity of this subject.},

Results showed that the park was on an average 1.1°C cooler than the square. The relatively warmer thermal conditions in the square in comparison to the park resulted in a heat load of greater intensity for humans in the square. In general, there was a low relation between the thermal environment and the use of the two places in terms of total attendance. However, the use of the park was influenced more by the thermal conditions than by the use of the square, which can mainly be attributed to the different functions of the two places. Finally, examples of the differences between the use of the sun, the attitudes toward it, and outdoor exposure in Japan and Sweden are highlighted and discussed.},

	abstract = {The 2020 coronavirus pandemic caused countries across the world to implement measures of social distancing to curb spreading of {COVID}-19. The large and sudden disruptions to everyday life that result from this are likely to impact well-being, particularly among urban populations that live in dense settings with limited public space. In this paper, we argue that during these extraordinary circumstances, urban nature offers resilience for maintaining well-being in urban populations, while enabling social distancing. We discuss more generally the critical role of urban nature in times of crisis. Cities around the world need to take the step into the 21st century by accepting crises as a new reality and finding ways to function during these disturbances. Thus, maintaining or increasing space for nature in cities and keeping it accessible to the public should be part of the sustainability agenda, aiming simultaneously to strive towards {SDG} 3 (good health and well-being), and {SDG} 11 (sustainable and resilient cities).},

 This paper offers a brief tour of green spaces across three iconic metropolitan sites - London, Paris and New York - to consider how the axioms of recreation, industrial modernity and public health operated in specific urban contexts. Of particular note is the fact that park planners embraced
 an holistic vision, often articulated via bodily metaphors, that incorporated both social and environmental aspects: thus behind apparently nostalgic visions for a pre-industrial bucolic greenery lay irrefutably modern approaches to urban planning that presaged twenty and twenty-first century
 holistic experiments in garden cities and 'living homes.' Also central to this study is the idea of the park as a liminal space and an eminently readable landscape: an evolving site of translation, negotiation and {transformatioFn} that highlights the fertile ground of cross-disciplinary study
 and the benefits of a complex ecological history that involves close examination of place, action and imagery.},

	abstract = {Purpose
              It is observed that the {COVID}-19 Pandemic mostly restricts people's movement and walking habits. In this direction, this study aims to highlight how the walking behaviors of individuals affected in different geographies' neighborhoods before and during the Pandemic.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              This paper focuses on the relationship between neighborhood characteristics and the changing walking behavior of 24 sample regions (514 participants) with the highest incidents of {COVID}-19 infection from American, European, Asian, Western Pacific, African and Middle Eastern cities. The paper's methodology is supported by an /online questionnaire survey conducted in these 24 disparate neighborhoods in December 2020.
            
            
              Findings
              Findings show that “walkable access” varies over geographies during the Pandemic. Urban amenities within 15–20 min of access become more important than ever. The results unravel that either walkable or non-walkable neighborhoods showcased similarities despite that urban amenities were not within 15–20 min of access. Three prominent aspects should be emphasized to plan walkable neighborhoods: providing walkable access, forming spatial proximity and sustaining social cohesion.
            
            
              Social implications
              The availability of daily amenities, such as shopping stores, health care, education services and pharmacies within a 15–20-min walking distance maintain everyday life and increase social interactions. In addition, places with walkable access encourage an active lifestyle and contribute the public health. The impact of the {COVID}-19 Pandemic movement restrictions on the walking behavior of individuals highlights how the qualities of distance-based urban planning need to be supported with time-based practical attributes that can shape neighborhood planning frameworks.
            
            
              Originality/value
              This paper highlights the coexistence of “walkability” and “accessibility” measures in urban practice and research to create resilient and sustainable neighborhoods. The “walkable access” term used in the paper addresses joint measures of walkability and accessibility.},

	abstract = {Historically, documenting visitor counts in park, recreation, and tourism spaces has been fraught with challenges that often result in data with questionable reliability and validity. However, these counts are necessary for managers in that they inform budgets, staffing, and policy. The purpose of this methodological study is to detail the processes involved in implementing technology-based counting systems within parks with the goal of assisting managers who wish to modernize visitor counting procedures. The first step involves a detailed site analysis, with considerations specific to park boundaries, access to power sources, the availability of {WiFi}, and whether lighting is needed for the technology to function. Once the site analysis is completed, the technology options can be considered, with the understanding that the accuracy of the counts will be impacted by visitor flow, focal area of interest, the number of counters utilized, whether visitors must be carrying {WiFi}-enabled devices to be counted, data transmission options, and access to dynamic features such as those that eliminate double counts. A case study approach was used to demonstrate implementation procedures, focusing on site and technology selection, then moving on to installation considerations, data collection, validation, data analysis, and management implications. The Korean War Veterans Memorial ({KOWA}), a National Park Service holding located within the National Mall and Memorial Parks in Washington, {DC}, was selected as an optimal site based on semi-porous boundaries, consistent visitor flows, and ready access to power sources. After consideration of price, privacy, ease of installation, and ready access to data, 3D people counters were the chosen technology. The counters were installed in weatherproofed housings and mounted on lampposts that were situated at the two main entrance sites to the memorial. Analysis of twelve weeks of data indicated that the counting accuracy of the 3D counters was high, minimal modifications were needed, and visitor privacy was retained. A similar methodological approach can be applied by park managers within a wide variety of settings.},

This study aimed to identify if such regulations provided residents with equal access to public open spaces ({POS}) to engage in physical activity during the lockdown. Using a mixed research method (secondary descriptive data, field observations, and spatial analysis), we assessed the one-kilometer walking limit imposed on six typical existing neighborhoods in Jeddah city, Saudi Arabia. We find that the imposed one-kilometer limit was effective in providing accessibility, and the four urban factors ensured the effectiveness of the imposed walking distance: the small scale of residential districts in comparison to the long-imposed walking distance; the presence of neighborhood parks near main local streets; the distribution of neighborhood parks throughout the districts; and the absence of major highways that physically isolated residential districts. Notably, regulations related to walking distances during future pandemics should not be generalized to all cities; instead, they should be based on the existing availability of relatively good {POS} provisions with easy and equal access to all community members to enhance social sustainability.},

We investigate one methodological issue, aggregation error, as it relates to the measurement of {NSA}. Aggregation error arises when, for the purpose of distance calculations, a single point is used to represent a neighbourhood, which in turn represents an aggregation of spatially distributed individuals. {NSA} to three types of recreational amenities (playgrounds, community halls, and leisure centres) in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada is used to assess whether aggregation error affects {NSA} measures. The authors use exploratory spatial data analysis techniques, including local indicators of spatial association, to examine aggregation-error effects on {NSA}. By integrating finer resolution data into {NSA} measures, we demonstrate that aggregation error does affect {NSA} indicators, but that the effect depends on the type of amenity under investigation. Aggregation error is particularly problematic when measuring {NSA} to amenities that are abundant and have highly localized service areas, such as playgrounds. We recommend that, when analyzing {NSA} to these types of amenities, researchers integrate finer resolution data to indicate the spatial distribution of individuals within neighbourhoods better, and hence reduce aggregation error.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            The {COVID}-19 pandemic has resulted in over 33 million confirmed cases and over 1 million deaths globally, as of 1 October 2020. During the lockdown and restrictions placed on public activities and gatherings, green spaces have become one of the only sources of resilience amidst the coronavirus pandemic, in part because of their positive effects on psychological, physical and social cohesion and spiritual wellness. This study analyzes the impacts of {COVID}-19 and government response policies to the pandemic on park visitation at global, regional and national levels and assesses the importance of parks during this global pandemic. The data we collected primarily from Google’s Community Mobility Reports and the Oxford Coronavirus Government Response Tracker. The results for most countries included in the analysis show that park visitation has increased since February 16th, 2020 compared to visitor numbers prior to the {COVID}-19 pandemic. Restrictions on social gathering, movement, and the closure of workplace and indoor recreational places, are correlated with more visits to parks. Stay-at-home restrictions and government stringency index are negatively associated with park visits at a global scale. Demand from residents for parks and outdoor green spaces has increased since the outbreak began, and highlights the important role and benefits provided by parks, especially urban and community parks, under the {COVID}-19 pandemic. We provide recommendations for park managers and other decision-makers in terms of park management and planning during health crises, as well as for park design and development. In particular, parks could be utilized during pandemics to increase the physical and mental health and social well-being of individuals.},

This includes new parks and other open spaces, landscaped plazas or public squares associated with new office towers, shopping centers and other large-scale commercial developments, and various popular “festival sites” such as those along recreation waterfronts. A comparison indicates that both cities have quite a few new public spaces that enhance the quality of urban life and add aesthetic appeal, but that also reflect certain social problems and divisions. We see the following common trends: (1) increasing privatization of spaces that were once more clearly in the public domain; (2) increasing surveillance of public spaces and control of access to them in order to improve security; and (3) increasing use of design themes that employ “theme park” simulations and break connections with local history and geography. In the Tokyo area there is also a curious trend to create large, landscaped open areas near new development projects that few people use. They can be called “planned wastelands” or “new urban deserts”. New York City, on the other hand, has succeeded in having more people come together for enjoyment in parts of the city that were once all but abandoned. The paper is illustrated with photographs, and draws on the examples of Times Square, South Street Seaport and Battery Park City in New York, and Yebisu Garden Place, Teleport–Daiba, Makuhari New Town and Minato Mirai 21 in the Tokyo–Yokohama area.},

The relationship between ridership and network design was studied by using updated graph theory concepts. Ridership was computed as the annual number of boardings per capita. Network design was measured according to three major indicators. The first is a measure of transit coverage and is based on the total number of stations and land area. The second relates to the maximum number of transfers necessary to go from one station to another and is called directness. The third attempts to get an overall view of transfer possibilities to travel in the network to appreciate a sense of mobility; it is termed connectivity. Multiple-regression analysis showed a strong relationship between these three indicators and ridership, achieving a goodness of fit (adjusted R2 value) of .725. The importance of network design is significant and should be considered in future public transportation projects.},

These patterns are not strongly related to differences in wealth between cities, but do vary in a clear and systematic way with land use patterns. The total fixed and variable cost of cars per kilometre is also significantly related to the degree of automobile dependence in cities, though not as strongly as land use. The data suggest that the most auto-dependent cities are less wealthy than some other more transit-oriented cities. They have the worst operating cost recovery in transit, have far higher road construction and maintenance costs, spend the highest proportion of their wealth on passenger transportation but have roughly similar journey-to-work trip times and much longer trip lengths. These patterns suggest some important policy implications which stress the need to strategically reshape urban land use, to emphasise investment in non-auto infrastructure and to ensure that any physical planning strategies aimed at reducing automobile dependence work in concert with economic policies directed at increasing the real cost of both car ownership and car use.},

Methodologically, a study of three case cities that have adopted this new model of city vision, is carried out. The analysis focus on understanding how the idea of 15-min cities fits the legacies of different cities as described by traditional planning principles in the context of three evaluation pillars: inclusion, safety and health. The paper argues that the 15-min city approach is not a radical new idea since it utilizes long established planning principles. Nevertheless, it uses these principles to achieve the bottom-up promotion of wellbeing while it proposes an alternative way to think about optimal resource allocation in a citywide scale. Hence, application of 15-min city implies a shift in the emphasis of planning from the accessibility of neighborhood to urban functions to the proximity of urban functions within neighborhoods, along with large systemic changes in resource allocation patterns and governance schemes citywide.},
